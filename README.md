# Aurora

Aurora is a Soundcloud clone that gives creators a platform to upload their tracks and share it with the community. Creators will be able to interact with other creators by reacting (e.g. 'like', 'dislike', 'heart', 'wow', and 'cool' reactions) and commenting on their work. Creators will be able to listen to, create, edit, and delete tracks. Additionally, they will also be able to create, read, edit and delete their comments under a specific track. The reaction feature gives creators another way to express their thoughts on a track as they will be able to react, see reacts, and revoke their existing react under a specific track. Enjoy the Aurora experience!
